# SkyDB_IDX_Project

For this bounty, we’re looking for someone to build a project that makes use of IDX as an identity protocol alongside SkyDB. To achieve this, during onboarding you can use the IDX SDK to import or create identities, add your user’s SkyDB instance for your application to their identity index, and query their index for their data stored throughout the Web3 ecosystem – on any other Web3 platform. Feel free to use IDX for additional in-app features such as user profiles, social graphs, or anything else you can imagine. IDX allows you to store this identity metadata natively in documents on the Ceramic network, where it can be consumed everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem – within Sia applications and beyond.

### Submission Requirements:
- The project must be open source
- The app must live on Skynet at a Skynet URL
- The app should do something that is useful and interesting
- The app must use IDX to connect a user to a SkyDB instance
- The app may optionally use IDX for things like profiles, social graphs, and other fun features
- Demo videos are strongly recommended for complete submissions (upload your videos to Skynet!)
